# Language Recognition AI

This AI uses Python and Keras to recognize what language a given word is. 

To generate the data, it uses the Yandex translation API, and 3000 English words.

If you wish to run it yourself, feel free to tweak the parameters of the network itself. To generate the data, you will need to put in your own API key with Yandex.

I have very little experience in AI, so please excuse any obvious errors.
